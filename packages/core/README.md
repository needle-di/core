Needle DI is a lightweight, TypeScript-first library for dependency injection (DI). It is designed to be both easy to use and highly efficient.

### Key Features

- Stand-alone: No additional dependencies required
- Intended for both JavaScript-only and TypeScript projects
- Supports [tree-shakeable injection tokens](https://needle-di.io/advanced/tree-shaking.html): optimize your builds for production.
- Inspired by [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS), familiar to developers coming from these frameworks.
- Uses native [ECMAScript decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) (currently stage 3)
- No need for `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata`
- No reflection libraries needed, like `reflect-metadata` or other reflection mechanisms.

## Basic example

Here’s a simple example using constructor injection to inject one service into another.

```typescript
import { injectable, inject } from "@needle-di/core";

@injectable()
class FooService {}

@injectable()
class BarService {
  constructor(private fooService = inject(FooService)) {}
  //                  ^? Type will be inferred as `FooService`
}
```

The `@injectable` decorator eliminates the need to manually register services. To construct the `BarService`, create a
dependency injection container, and use the `container.get()` method:

```typescript
import { Container } from "@needle-di/core";

const container = new Container();
const barService = container.get(BarService);
//    ^? Type will be inferred as `BarService`
```

## Installation

```
npm install --save @needle-di/core
```

Needle DI also works with [Deno](https://deno.com/) and is published to [JSR](https://jsr.io/@needle-di/core) as well:

```bash
deno add jsr:@needle-di/core
```
